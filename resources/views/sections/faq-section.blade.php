                Our product service prices are available in pricing section but if you had a particularly original idea and making a new project It depends on many things: project scope, time spent on the project and technological issues. We know it sounds vague but its simply honest. Remember that each software project is different.

                Whether you want to expand your product or create a completely new one simultaneously, and then again focus only on one of your projects, we are always ready to adapt to your requirements. If the work is less intense team size can be reduced. When improvements need to be implemented fast, we can quickly assign additional team members to speed up each phase of the development process.
